    When running (in parallel) each task will only be activated when its
    dependencies have been satisified. When a graph is split into two or more
    segments, both of those segments will be ran in parallel.

    For example lets take this small little *somewhat complicated* graph:

    X--Y--C--D

    A--B--    --G--
          |  |     |--Z(end)

    In this flow the following will be ran in parallel at start:
     1. X--Y
     2. A--B
     3. E--F
    Note the C--D nodes will not be able to run until [Y,B,F] has completed.
    After C--D completes the following will be ran in parallel:
     1. G
     2. H
    Then finally Z will run (after [G,H] complete) and the flow will then have
    finished executing.
