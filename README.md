============

What is Billingstack?
BillingStack is a convergence of efforts done in the previous started Bufunfa
project and the BillingStack Grails (Java) version by Luis Gervaso.

The goal is to provide a free alternative to anyone that has a need for a
subscription based billingsystem with features compared to other popular ones.


Features include:
* Plans - Collections of Products like Compute Gold or similar
* Products - A Compute server for example
* Merchants - Multi-Tenancy via Merchants where the Merchant is the Tenant of
              the application and can have multiple Customers, it's own
              settings etc.

* Plugin based Storage API - The Storage API is pluggable and other backends
              can be added.
* REST API - Currently based on Pecan for V1.
